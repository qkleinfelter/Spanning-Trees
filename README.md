# Spanning-Trees
This project implements Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Trees of a weighted, undirected graph.
The specifications for this project were provided by Dr. Larry Thomas at the University of Toledo. This was completed during the Spring 2020 semester of Non-Linear Data Structures.
